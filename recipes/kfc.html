<h2>Description</h2>
<p>They said it couldn’t be done—but dare we say our homemade version of KFC™ fried chicken is better than the original
    recipe? We start with a flavorful combination of 11 spices you already have in your pantry and combined them with
    flour and brown sugar to create the makings of that savory KFC™ crunch you crave. After that, it doesn’t get any
    easier than dredging the chicken and frying it up in hot oil. If you’ve ever wondered how to make KFC™ chicken, the
    secret is here.</p>




<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>

</ul>


<li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
<li>2 teaspoons onion salt</li>
<li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
<li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon celery salt</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon dried sage</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon ground allspice</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon dried basil</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon dried marjoram</li>
<li>1 1/2 cups Gold Medal™ all-purpose flour</li>
<li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
<li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
<li>1 whole chicken (2 breasts, 2 thighs, 2 drumsticks, 2 wings)</li>
<li>1 egg white</li>
<li>2 quarts neutral oil, for frying</li>


<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>
            Preheat fryer to 350°F. Thoroughly mix together all spices.
        </p>

    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Combine spices with flour, brown sugar and salt.
        </p>

    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Dip chicken pieces in egg white to lightly coat them, then transfer to flour mixture. Turn a few times and
            make sure the flour mix is really stuck to the chicken. Repeat with all the chicken pieces.
        </p>

    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Let chicken pieces rest for 5 minutes so crust has a chance to dry a bit.
        </p>

    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Fry chicken in batches. Breasts and wings should take 12-14 minutes, and legs and thighs will need a few
            more minutes. Chicken pieces are done when a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part reads 165°F.
        </p>

    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Let chicken drain on a few paper towels when it comes out of the fryer. Serve hot.
